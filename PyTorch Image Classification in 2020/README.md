# Python Image Classification in 2020  

This webinar was conducted on 12th April 2020 in association with [Facebook Developer Circles Sweden](https://www.linkedin.com/company/developercirclesfromfacebook/ "Facebook Developer Circles Sweden") and [People in Data](https://www.linkedin.com/company/people-in-data/ "People in Data").  

The `Image_Classification_master.ipynb` notebook contains the complete code along with the comments and explanations.  
The `Image_Classification_practice.ipynb` is the notebook I used to code live during the webinar.
